# ParetoMovies: Fetch IMDb Movie Ratings with Python

Welcome to ParetoMovies! This Python script allows you to fetch IMDb ratings for your favorite movies directly from a CSV file. With this tool, you can make your movie nights even more exciting by picking films based on ratings! 

The script leverages a few powerful Python libraries and the OMDB API to do the magic:

1. **Requests** for dispatching HTTP requests üåê
2. **Pandas** for managing and processing data üêº
3. **tqdm** for displaying progress bars üíπ
4. **Tkinter** for crafting a smooth and interactive GUI üñºÔ∏è
5. **OMDB API** for extracting those sought-after movie ratings üåü

If you don't have an OMDB API key, don't fret - the tutorial on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ILe4A_s-9I) will guide you through the process!

## How to Run the Script

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
